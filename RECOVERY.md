# Recovering a failed local service

A Hub2 can remain cloud-controllable while its HTTP service stops accepting LAN
connections. Issue #7 reports recovery after a controller power cycle; the owner's
HA logs also showed connection failure and HTTP 500, and the owner recovered the
service with the vendor app's Soft Reboot action. The firmware failure's cause is
unknown. Reboot recovery does not establish that polling caused or fixed it.

## Cloud fallback

For an account-based entry, uncheck **Disable all Gemstone cloud access** and keep
**Use local control when available** enabled. HA then uses cloud reads and writes
when LAN fails. Without automatic recovery, it retries LAN after five minutes.
Strict local-only mode deliberately becomes unavailable when its local route
fails; it never contacts the cloud, even if an automatic-recovery preference was
previously saved. A controller added without an account has no cloud credentials.

## Manual soft reboot

An HA administrator can run this action even while the light is unavailable:

```yaml
action: gemstone_lights.soft_reboot
data:
  controller: light.your_controller
```

It requires a working cloud account and fresh discovery reporting that controller
online in the account. Requests are serialized per controller and duplicate
requests within two minutes are rejected. The action returns when the cloud
request succeeds, not when the controller has restarted. Allow about one minute
for the reboot; LAN probes resume after a 90-second grace period. Lighting state
is not replaced or replayed by this action.

## Optional automatic recovery

Enable **Automatically soft reboot after persistent LAN failure** in Configure.
It is off by default. The default failure duration is 10 minutes (configurable
5–60); the cooldown is six hours (configurable 1–168).

Recovery requires all of the following:

- At least three failed LAN state probes against the same address, spanning the
  configured failure duration. With recovery enabled, failed LAN probes are
  retried at one-minute intervals; ordinary cloud polling remains unchanged.
- Successful cloud state access and fresh account discovery reporting the same
  controller online, with local commands enabled and the same LAN address.
- No previous automatic attempt in this outage, and expiry of the cooldown from
  any previous manual or automatic attempt.

One attempt is allowed per uninterrupted outage. An HTTP error or lost response
consumes that attempt too: repeating an uncertain reboot could cause a loop. The
attempt is stored **before** the request and survives integration reloads and HA
restarts. A successful local state read ends the outage, but does not clear the
cooldown. If storage cannot persist the attempt, no reboot is sent.

Automatic recovery never reacts to Bluetooth failures, disabled local commands,
a changed cloud-reported IP address, unavailable cloud authentication, or strict
local-only operation. It does not factory-reset or modify Wi-Fi credentials.
Cloud online status is vendor-reported, not independent proof of physical
reachability. If a reboot fails to restore LAN, investigate the controller and
network rather than automatically rebooting it again.

## Protocol evidence

The Android app 0.6.64 generated the following request during an intercepted
Soft Reboot confirmation on 2026-09-17. The capture proxy blocked the request
before forwarding it, and emulator networking was restored afterward:

```http
POST /prod/deviceControl/softReboot?deviceId=<controller>&homegroupId=<homegroup>
Authorization: Bearer <account access token>
```

The body was empty. This POST is an exception to the lighting API's PUT routes.
The integration resolves the homegroup through fresh discovery; it does not
hard-code an owner's identifiers. Authentication and transport errors are
surfaced, and the reboot request is not automatically retried even on an HTTP
401/403. LAN readback, rather than HTTP acceptance alone, establishes recovery.

## Physical validation

On the owner's Hub2 firmware 1.1.5, the candidate HA action returned HTTP 200.
An independent LAN monitor observed the local API become unreachable and then
return after approximately 19 seconds. The entire reported playing state matched
the pre-test state exactly; no lighting restoration write was needed. This
verifies the manual cloud command and reboot cycle. The automatic failure policy
is exercised through simulated external I/O, not by deliberately crashing the
controller's HTTP service.
